# Overview
This project uses data previously mined in an earlier project. Although the data is not entirely suitable for detailed customer segmentation and comprehensive insights, I have processed it and built a dashboard to display key information.

# Features
  * Data Processing: Utilized Excel functions like IF, VLOOKUP, TEXT, and REPLACE for data manipulation and analysis.
* Dashboard: Created various charts and PivotTables to visualize data.

# Open the Excel file
In the project directory, open the Excel file to view the dashboard and data.

# Limitations
The data is not entirely suitable for detailed customer segmentation.
# Lessons Learned
* Advanced Excel functions (IF, VLOOKUP, TEXT, REPLACE).
